To compile all the binaries, write

./unix.sh        ;under un*x.
msdos.bat        ;under msdos and djgpp.
execute amiga    ;under amigaos 1-3.
execute amigaos4 ;under amigaos 4.
win32            ;under win32 and cygwin (www.cygwin.com) or mingw (www.mingw.org).

You can find the executables under the binaries directory.

If the system tries to link/compile with cc you might run into trouble.
Try to redefine shell enviroment variables CC and LD to gcc, e.g., in bash:

export CC='gcc'
export LD='gcc'

Gcc should compile WLA DX just fine.
